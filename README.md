## Instacart_Analysis

A data analysis project as part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics program. Through the use of Python, open-source datasets from Instacart are analyzed.

### Objective

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. They would like to uncover more information about their sales pattern and are interested in a targeted marketing strategy. Based on the types of customers and their purchasing behaviour, they want to see if their marketing campaign will have an effect on product sales.

### Data

The open-source dataset is available on Instacart's website and can be located [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017)
