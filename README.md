## Instacart_Analysis

A data analysis project as part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics program. Through the use of Python, open-source datasets from Instacart are analyzed.

### Objective

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. They would like to uncover more information about their sales pattern and are interested in a targeted marketing strategy. Based on the types of customers and their purchasing behaviour, they want to see if their marketing campaign will have an effect on product sales.

### Data

The open-source dataset is available on Instacart's website and can be found [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017). A customer dataset was created by Career Foundry for the sole purpose of this project and can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/customers.zip)

### Tools

- Python: Various libraries were utilized for creating dataframes and visualizations. These include: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Jupyter Notebook: Scripts containing all the steps taken to wrangle and clean data, as well as create different types of charts/graphs.
